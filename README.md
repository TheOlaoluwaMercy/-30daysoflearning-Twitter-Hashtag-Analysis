### Time and Trend Analysis
The hashtag gathered more interactions in June, than in May and July. This is the expected trend because the program started in June. Tweets from May are by the organizers to sensitize students about the learning oppourtunity. 
There are lesser tweets during weekends. The fact that lesser learning activities are slated for weekends in the #30daysoflearning program schedule might be a factor contributing to this.
